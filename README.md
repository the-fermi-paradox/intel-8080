# Space Invaders - Emulator
*This project is a work in progress.*
The final goal of this project is to have a working emulator that can accurately duplicate the complete functionality of the game Space Invaders, and its accompanying Intel 8080 chip, on a Linux x86 machine.
##TODO:
- complete implementation of the Intel 8080 instruction set
- keyboard input
- interrupt handling
- graphics display (SDL?)
- sound (PortAudio?)
