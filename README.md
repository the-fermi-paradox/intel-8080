# Intel 8080 Emulator
**This project is a work in progress.**

The final goal of this project is to have a working emulator that 
can accurately duplicate the complete functionality of the game 
Space Invaders and its accompanying Intel 8080 chip.

It now contains a complete and well-tested implementation of the Intel 8080 
instruction set. The ISA can be tested by running the `test` binary generated by 
`make test`. It currently expects a directory at the source level called "roms", 
which must have the following four files in it:
```c++
const char *test_files[] = {"CPUTEST.COM", "TST8080.COM", "8080PRE.COM", "8080EXM.COM",};
```
These have been packaged with this repo for your convenience. 

The process for testing the emulator is thus as follows:
```bash
make test
./test
```
Independently, the emulator itself lives in `cpu.c`. We provide an interface
via `make main` or just `make`. Simply supply any valid Intel 8080 machine code and 
it will properly execute the instructions. There is currently no support for interrupts
or I/O.

You can specify an offset with `-o [offset]`. This will load the file into memory,
starting at `offset`.

## TODO:
- :green_square: complete implementation of the Intel 8080 instruction set
- :red_square: keyboard input
- :red_square: interrupt handling
- :red_square: graphics display (SDL?)
- :red_square: sound (PortAudio?)
