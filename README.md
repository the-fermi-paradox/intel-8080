# Intel 8080 Emulator

This project contains contains a complete and well-tested implementation of the
Intel 8080 instruction set. The ISA can be tested by running the `test`
binary generated by `make test`. It currently expects a directory at the source
level called "roms", which must have the following four files in it:

```c++
const char *test_files[] = {"CPUTEST.COM", "TST8080.COM", "8080PRE.COM", "8080EXM.COM",};
```

These have been packaged with this repo for your convenience.

The process for testing the emulator is thus as follows:
```bash
make test
./test
```
We provide an example interface in `main.c` which can be created with `main`.
This is a simple command line program that loads a file into memory and then
performs CPU operations. Using the interface is simple: supply a file containing
valid Intel 8080 machine code and it will sequentially execute the instructions.

There is no support for interrupts, graphics, or I/O, as these were
handled by other components on machines running the 8080.

Independently, the emulator itself lives in `cpu.h` and `cpu.c`, which together
are enough to serve as a drop-in CPU for many other projects emulating other 
machines that historically used the Intel 8080.

In the example interface, you can specify an offset with `-o [offset]`.
This will load the file into memory, starting at `offset`.
